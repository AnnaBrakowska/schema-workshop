Schema Workshop
======
In this one-day workshop, we'll take a closer look at GraphQL's schema definition language. We'll start with a refresher of GraphQL schema basics like built-in types, built-in scalars, and fields. Then we'll dig in to more complex topics like enums, interfaces, unions, and mutation response objects. We'll then tie these threads together by building an API to understand how we might approach these projects in the real world.
